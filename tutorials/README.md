# Tutorial Series

This package comes with a set of Jupyter notebooks designed as a structured tutorial series in **numerical methods**, both mathematically rigorous and hands-on with code.

## Core Tutorials

1. [Tutorial 1: Vectors and Matrices](./tutorial1_vectors_matrices.ipynb)

   - Definitions of vectors and matrices.
   - Vector operations: addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, norms.
   - Matrix operations: addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse.
   - Matrix and vector norms.
   - Examples with `numethods.linalg`.

2. [Tutorial 2: Linear Systems of Equations](./tutorial2_linear_systems.ipynb)

   - Gaussian elimination and Gauss–Jordan.
   - LU decomposition.
   - Cholesky decomposition.
   - Iterative methods: Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.
   - Examples with `numethods.solvers`.

3. [Tutorial 3: Orthogonalization and QR Factorization](./tutorial3_orthogonalization.ipynb)

   - Inner products and orthogonality.
   - Gram–Schmidt process (classical and modified).
   - Householder reflections.
   - QR decomposition and applications.
   - Examples with `numethods.orthogonal`.

4. [Tutorial 4: Root-Finding Methods](./tutorial4_root_finding.ipynb)

   - Bisection method.
   - Fixed-point iteration.
   - Newton’s method.
   - Secant method.
   - Convergence analysis and error behavior.
   - Trace outputs for iteration history.
   - Examples with `numethods.roots`.
